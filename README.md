    ## ðŸ’¡ Hints
    
    * Take a look at the API response from the GitHub API to get an idea of how the data is structured. Example: <https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/repos?per_page=100>.
    
      * Avoid continually refreshing this page since there's a limit for non-authenticated requests to the GitHub API.
